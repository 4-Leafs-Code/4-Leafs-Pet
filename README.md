I made this MVP version of a virtual pet as my final project for    
Spring22 MIT 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.   
    
I made of all of the pixel graphics myself in Microsofts Paint 3D app and the main code is writen in python.   
This project was ment to showcase my knowledge on the topics we covered throughout the course and I recieved an A+.
   
   Someday I would like to continue building this into a fully functional virtual pet game.    
   Anyone is more then welcome to build off of my code. If you do continue building this, please show me what you accomplish.
