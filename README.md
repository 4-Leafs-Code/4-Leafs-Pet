## If your looking at my repo please click the star button! Thank you so much!


I'm donating this game to the community for them to play with, pass it around, have some fun togather doing what we love! Do what you like, what ever makes you happy!

* I have some extra graphics in the files, if you would like the set up the timer and have it start as an egg. 
* The icons are rendered to the screen if you want to set up some functionality for one of them or all off them. 
* I made a wordel game for 6.0001 that would give you a score. I was going to figur out how to connect games like that to this, so I could play and increase 4s happiness. 
* Maybe build a little store with treats and use game points to buy stuff. 
* Maybe add some other graphics so the user can choose between pets. 
* One thing it will need at some point is a save feature so it does not start from the begining everytime you run the program. 
* If you have some serious skills, you can make the timer keep running when the game is shut down and alert the user that 4 wants or needs something.

These are just some ideas I had when I built this and I'm hoping it will get your creative juices flowing. It doesent even have to stay as a virtual pet. I'm courious to see what my contributors make of this and learn from it.

The possibilitys are endless, what do you want to do... Just make a fork, please keep your branch up todate and push often, so you can build off each other.

I made this MVP version of a virtual pet as my final project for    
Spring22 MIT 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.   
    
I made of all the pixel graphics myself in Microsoft's Paint 3D app and the main code is writen in python.   
This project was ment to showcase my knowledge on the topics we covered throughout the course, and I received an A+.

Just install Pygame:   
pip install pygame   
   
And run the fourleaf.py file.   
   
   Someday I would like to continue building this into a fully functional virtual pet game.    
   Anyone is more than welcome to build on my code. If you do continue building this, please show me what you accomplish.
